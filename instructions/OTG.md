# OTG Setup Guide

Easily run ADB commands on other Android devices using the OTG (On-The-Go) feature. This guide walks you through the entire setup process in a clear and simple way.

</br>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Host Device**: The Android device that will send **ADB** commands, i.e. the device with **`aShell You`** app installed
- **Target Device**: The Android device that will receive and execute the commands  
- **OTG Cable or Adapter**: To physically connect both devices  
- **USB Debugging**: Enabled on the target device ([How to enable](usbdeb.md))  
> **Basic knowledge of ADB commands** is helpful but not necessary

</br>

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Connect both devices** using an OTG cable or adapter  
2. **Enable USB Debugging** on the **target** device  
   > [View the USB Debugging Setup Guide](usbdeb.md)
3. **Open `aShellYou`** on the **host** device  
4. Go to the **OTG** section in the app’s navigation  
5. When prompted on the target device, **allow USB debugging access**  
6. You're all set — start executing ADB commands like a pro!
